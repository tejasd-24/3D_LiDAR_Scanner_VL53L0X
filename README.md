# 3D_LiDAR_Scanner_VL53L0X
A low-cost 3D object scanner using the VL53L0X ToF sensor, ESP32, and stepper motors. It scans objects on a rotating turntable, captures distance data, converts it to (x, y, z) coordinates, and outputs a point cloud in a .txt file. Ideal for embedded systems and 3D mappingÂ projects.
